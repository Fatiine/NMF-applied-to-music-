# NMF-applied-to-music-
Estimation of musical notes consists in producing a symbolic representation of a piece of music from the sole audio content. The goal is to extract information about the notes played (start, end, height, intensity ...) and store it in a matrix. We will use non-negative matrix (NMF) methods to represent the signal in a form that can be interpreted intuitively.
